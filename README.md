# BEP-20 Play-to-Earn Game Smart Contract

This is a NTF-Based Game project aimed towards building an interactive game with but not limited to focus on Play-to-Earn models.
In this repository you will find prototype files for smart contracts based on BEP-20 Tokens aimed to be built upon Binance Smart Chain, using Hardhat as development environment.

This application is built based on BEP-20 Smart Contracts, optimized to be deployed at Binance Smart Chain Testnet.<br>
It was mainly built to to learn how "**2021 NFT-Based P2E Games**" work in the background.

BEP-20 Smart Contracts are written in Solidity language.<br>
You can check BEP-20 Standards and create your contracts based on it.

Front-end for this exact contract can be found at the following repository:<br>
